            <p> Robert Toru Kiyosaki (born April 8,1947) is an American businessman and author.
                He is the founder of Rich Global LLC and the Rich Dad Company, a private financial 
                education company that provides personal finance and business education to people via 
                books & videos. The company's main revenues come from franchisees of the Rich Dad seminars 
                that are conducted by independent individuals using Kiyosaki's brand name for a fee.
                He is also the creator of the Cashflow board and software games to educate adults and 
                children about business and financial concepts.<br>

                He is the author of more than 26 books, including the international self-published 
                personal finance Rich Dad Poor Dad series of books which has been translated into 51 languages 
                and sold over 41 million copies worldwide.<br>
                His financial and business teachings focus on what he calls 
                "financial education": generating passive income by focusing on business and investment 
                opportunities, such as real estate investments, businesses, stocks and commodities, with the 
                goal of being able to support oneself by such investments alone and thus achieving true 
                financial independence.<br>

                He uses the term "Assets" for things that put money in one's pocket. He stresses the 
                importance of building up an asset first to fund one's liabilities instead of saving cash 
                or relying on a salary from a traditional job.
